Game information will eventually go here.

This project uses Paragon assets provided by Epic Games for free on the Unreal Marketplace.
Some sound effects and music is from Super Smash Brothers Melee (Nintendo), use is only temporary.
Some content is not included in the Content folder as the files are too large to include on Github.

		Traditional Mario Party like board game movement, rolling dice, landing on certain places grants rewards (Blue) or punishment (Red).
			Die/Dice
			Coins.
			Stars.
			Items.
		Minigames after all players take a turn.
			Minigames to come after board logic is done.

			Very low priority as I want the player to be able to do everything first, board movement might come early though.

Known Bug List:
	Character Select:
		If a player switches characters, in some cases, such as from Shinbi to Phase, the game will crash. This is due to an Engine issue in 4.20.1 and has been reported to and logged by Epic Games.
